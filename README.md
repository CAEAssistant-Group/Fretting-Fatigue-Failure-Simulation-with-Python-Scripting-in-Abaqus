# Fretting-Fatigue-Failure-Simulation-with-Python-Scripting-in-Abaqus
Fretting fatigue failure is wear and fatigue damage at the interface of two surfaces under small cyclic motion, causing friction, wear debris, and crack formation. This project offers a guide on simulating Fretting Fatigue failure in Abaqus, focusing on 2D models, custom meshing, Field Outputs for analysis, and automating parameter selection with Python scripting.
